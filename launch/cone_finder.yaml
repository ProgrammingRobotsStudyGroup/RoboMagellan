# Params for cutting throttle
# On a 640x480 size image, cone area is ~300 sq pixels @25'
# ~2500sp @10', ~8'sp @6', ~12500sp @5', ~20000sp @4'
# ~34000sp @3' and cone starts to cut and area may decrease
min_area: 300
threshold_tc_cone_size: 10000    # When this threshold is reached (~4')
max_tc_cone_size: 35000          # Cut throttle if this is reached (<3')
# Even after the throttle is cut, rover may continue to roll
tc_timeout: 1                    # Cut throttle after this timeout
tc_max: 8                        # Reset conditions after this time
