= How to Run a Mock Mission

1. Start MavProxy at the location of the first sample waypoint.
    cd ...path-to-ardupilot.../APMrover2
    sim_vehicle.py -l 37.659984,-121.8874624,0,45

2. In MavProxy, load the waypoint sample.
    MANUAL> wp load ...path-to-robo_magellan.../data/sample.qgc-wpl.txt

3. Start the simulation. Zoom and center the waypoints, if you like.
    roslaunch robo_magellan mock_mission.launch

4. Start the mission by going into AUTO mode within MavProxy.
    MANUAL> mode auto

In rviz, you should see the rover follow the waypoints. When a cone is visible,
the heading to the cone is shown with a red arrow.
