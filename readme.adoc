= PRSG RoboMagellan ROS node

== What's in the repository?
The current use of this repository is to simulate a ROS node for the purposes of developing automated build.
link:http://programmingrobotsstudygroup.github.io/2017RoboMagellan.html[See PRSG's project website for project details]

== This Repository is integrated with Jenkins!
*Continuous Integration Etiquette:*

* mailto:ProgrammingRobotsStudyGroup@gmail.com?Subject=Request%20RoboMagellan%20Build%20Access"[Request access to to Jenkins notifications] if you commit code here.

* Check out the test suite. (still being developed).

* Build and run the tests locally before pushing to Github.

* If you build and run the tests successfully locally, go ahead and push to Github.

* If you push to Jenkins and get an email failure, please fix it immediately!

== Prepare your System

=== 1. Install Ubuntu and ROS to UP and Test

* link:https://01.org/developerjourney/recipe/intel-realsense-robotic-development-kit[Follow Intel's steps].
* You should be able to run RViz.

=== 2. Install Chrony
Chrony implements Network Time Protocol, (NTP), in order to keep your system clock accurate. It is designed to work with intermittent network connections. 
----
sudo apt-get install chrony
----

=== 3. Make a catkin workspace
The script in a later step will expect to use an existing catkin workspace named "catkin_ws". If you haven't already created this please follow the steps link:http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment[here]. These are summarized below for convenience:
----
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
----
Finally add
----
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
----
to your ~/.bashrc file. 

=== 4. Configure Zeroconf
Add this line to your .bashrc file on the UP and your development machine. Reboot.
----
export ROS_HOSTNAME=`echo $HOSTNAME`.local
----

Reboot the machine and test configuration from both ends. 
If you named your machine 'robot' as advised in Intel documents, you should be able to ping the robot's processor from your machine. Substitue robot for your machine name if ou elected to use a different name.
----
$ ping robot.local
----

To test your laptop/development machine, 
----
$ ssh robot@robot.local
$ robot@robot.local's password: 
robot@robot:~$ ping my_machine.local
----


=== 5. Shutdown Switch
This step describes how to set up a pushbutton switch to gracefully shut down the UP. This may help avoid flash corruption. 

Install Rpi.GPIO. Try this first:

 sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio

If that doesn't work

 $ dpkg -L python-rpi.gpio
 $ wget http://ubilinux.com/ubilinux/pool/main/r/rpi-gpio/python-rpi.gpio_0.6.2%2bubi2-1_amd64.deb
 $ sudo dpkg -i python-rpi.gpio_0.6.2+ubi2-1_amd64.deb 
 $ sudo groupadd gpio
 $ sudo adduser robot gpio
 $ pico /etc/udev/rules.d99-gpio.rules
 SUBSYSTEM=="bcm2835-gpiomem", KERNEL=="gpiomem", GROUP="gpio", MODE="0660"
 SUBSYSTEM=="gpio", KERNEL=="gpiochip*", ACTION=="add", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'chown root:gpio /sys/class/gpio/export /sys/class/gpio/une
 SUBSYSTEM=="gpio", KERNEL=="gpio*", ACTION=="add", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'chown root:gpio /sys%p/active_low /sys%p/direction /sys%p/edge

The file 99-gpio.rules can be found in the doc directory.

Add `python /home/robot/catkin_ws/src/robo_magellan/scripts/shutdownSwitch.py &` to the UP in /etc/rc.local just before the existing `exit 0` line.

The shutdownSwitch.py script assumes a momentary, normally open switch is connected from UP board pin 18 to ground (pin 20). You may also need an external 10k pullup resistor from pin 18 to 3.3 V (pin 17). A fragment of the link:https://up-community.org/wiki/Pinout[UP pinout] is included here for clarity.

=== 6. Get the Code
You will need ROS Kinetic installed on your machine. 

Install link:https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md[MAVROS]. Just use apt-get.

 sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-mavros ros-kinetic-mavros-extras

If you haven't already done so, start by fetching the repository.

----
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingRobotsStudyGroup/robo_magellan.git
----

If you already have the repository, make sure it's up to date

 cd catkin_ws/src
 git pull

Then run the installation/update script:
----
roscd robo_magellan
./victoria.sh
----
