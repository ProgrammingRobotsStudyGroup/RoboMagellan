== Abstract
This objective is to make the sensor platform or base.

== RC Prep
Unbox and remove RC body.



== Cut the Plywood for the Sensor Platform
This approach presumes the body attachment pins (proper term?) are close to the same height. 

First you will want to cut the thin plywood to size. For the Stampede I used 330mm x 380mm (~13" x ~15").
Take advantage of existing square corners of the plywood.



== Mounting the Sensor Platform
X-Maxx uses <<Bracket Mounting>>.

Stampede uses <<Cotter Pin Mounting>>.


=== Bracket Mounting
The X-Maxx uses a unique mounting system. link:https://github.com/mw46d/EntdeckerL/tree/master/3D_Printing[One solution]


=== Cotter Pin Mounting
The mounting holes use the body attachment pins to secure the Sensor Platform to the RC Vehicle.

The body attachment pins so that they are parallel to the front edge of the vehicle.
Match holes. Measure/use square to make the front holes parallel to front of the Ply.

==== Marker Trick.
Using a marker to coat the body attachment pins. 
Be careful that the marker solvent doesn't harm your vehicle.



Drill holes, test chassis fit, use cotter pins.
* test chassis fit, use cotter pins

== Test fit Sensor Platform.
