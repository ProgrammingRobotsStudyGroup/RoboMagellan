= Chatty

Chatty uses audio and lights to send messages to alert the operator of current and changing conditions in the robot.

== Running Prototype
Terminal window 1
----
roslaunch robo_magellan chatty.launch
----

Terminal window 2
----
rostopic pub /play std_msgs/String "~/catkin_ws/src/robo_magellan/scripts/sounds/196889_2526129-lq.ogg"
----

== Requirements

* Chatty will consist of player and ROS node.
* The ROS node passes commands to the daemon. The daemon does the heavy lifting - use command pattern.
* Chatty will be able to be activated by shell script for integration with non-ROS code. e.g. emergency conditions, etc.


== Task list

1. Compare the various sound libraries in python. Put comparison in writing. Make a recommendation, e.g. pyaudio, pymedia, wxPython, snack, alsaaudio, etc. It would be nice to use a package from the base libraries. Some packages Iâ€™ve explored and rejected already:
 * pyglet - too large
 * winsound - only works on windows
 * pygame - too much overhead from unused gaming elements

2. Define set of audio notifications
 * ROS is starting
 * ROS is stopping
 * Switching to pause mode
 * Switching to manual mode
 * Switching to autonomous mode
 * Battery low voltage
 * Linux shutting down now
 * I see a cone!
 * I touched a cone!
 * Self diagnostic running
 * Drive
 * Navigation
 * Power
 * system OK
 * system ERROR
 
3. Find/make wav files for our use.
4. Design software - Class and sequence diagrams are preferable. A flow chart is acceptable.
5. ROS node. Node listens for some message pattern; upon detection, queues sound for play. Caller provides priority and other request data.

== Notes
 * One option is to use a boards which can play sound files. 
  ** Dedicated board requires only two pins to trigger. It actually    has more pins but only two are used.
  ** It's highly reliable but adds extra hardware to each machine that wants it

 * There is no audio out plug on UP, but there is another option.
 * BT, USB, etc can work.
 * This is the poor man/everyman version as this does not require specialty dedicated hardware

 * Need something on the Linux that plays different `tracks'    based on external triggers
 *  Linux desktops have some support for dbus and you can probably find a dbus-enabled audio player
