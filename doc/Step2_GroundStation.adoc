== Install Ground Station Software
This software is needed to program and control the rover. It typically is run on mainly on a laptop or PC. You will need this installed in order to work on your PixHawk.

ArduPilot has a web page to help you

== Test Assembly of Electronics
In order to completely configure your rover software, you need http://ardupilot.org/rover/docs/common-pixhawk-wiring-and-quick-start.html[several pieces of gear attached to your Pixhawk]. Is there a current load issue?

Notes

----

  Your radio may not come with the correct wiring harness attached. Check to ensure that it has 6 pins to connect to the PixHawk. If not, you should have a replacement wiring harness. 

  You must pry open the telemetry radio case. CAREFULLY open the case. As has been said the connectors are surface mounted and so easy to damage. Use the USB method to remove (add link).
