= To-Do List

- mock_cone_detector creates infinite area and overflows h
- new waypoints shorter than old don't delete existing waypoints
- adjust waypoints for start position and cone position
- cone area goes down when very close to cone
- reverse PWM does not work
- touch sensor does not work
- cone detection in bright light does not work
- PWM forward steering values are reversed
- PWM neutral points need to be configurable
- GUIDED mode does not work
- PWM values on grass must be different
- Encode PWM values or range set to use in the waypoints file
- Have a way of manually triggering parameter reload

== Notes

MAV_CMD_DO_SET_HOME appears to reset the map origin, as well as zero the
offset between the map origin and base_link (for /mavros/local_position/pose
and /mavros/local_position/odom).
