= To-Do List

- mock_cone_detector creates infinite area and overflows h
- (*DONE*) new waypoints shorter than old don't delete existing waypoints
- adjust waypoints for start position and cone position
- cone area goes down when very close to cone
- (*DONE*) parameterize throttle and steering PWM values
- touch sensor does not work
- (*DONE*) cone detection in bright light does not work
- GUIDED mode does not work
- Encode PWM values or range set to use in the waypoints file
- If waypoint encountered before cone is seen, rover goes into HOLD mode
with no recovery. Needs to be fixed.

== Possible To-Do

- (*DONE*) Change from using WP_SPEED to CRUISE_SPEED. (Seems to be used by Vicky,
while WP_SPEED is not.)
- Have a way of manually triggering parameter reload

== Notes

MAV_CMD_DO_SET_HOME appears to reset the map origin, as well as zero the
offset between the map origin and base_link (for /mavros/local_position/pose
and /mavros/local_position/odom).
