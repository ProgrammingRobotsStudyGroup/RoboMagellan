== Abstract
This text describes building an Autonomous, self navigating Rover employing ROS, ArduPilot, GPS, Innertial Motion Sensors, Cameras, etc.



== Forward
We've tried to make the fabrication of an autonomous vehicle a little easier by documenting our build. 
Whether for fun, research or commercial endeavors, There's plenty to learn, so let's get started.
